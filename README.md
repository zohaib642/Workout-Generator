Machine learning project with Python and scikit-learn. Creates unique workout plan based on height, weight, gender, age, and goal.

*IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE BMI IS NOT AN ACCURATE MESUREMENT OF OVERALL FITNESS: it does not take into account the person's body fat versus muscle (lean tissue) content*

Gender: female = 0, male = 1

BMIcase: severely thin = 1, moderately thin = 2, mildly thin = 3, normal = 4, overweight = 5, obese = 6, severely obese = 7

WILL ADD MORE TO README AS PROJECT FINALIZES
